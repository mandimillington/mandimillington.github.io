  		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Juice Bar is overwhelmingly vegetarian, gluten-free, organic when possible, and always uses 100% whole fruits and vegetables. Simply said, we are a “I want to eat healthy and feel great” type place, offering yummies like our Super Greens juice with local wheat grass, or our superfoods salad with kale, spinach, organic quinoa and fresh-juiced lemon dressing. In season we purchase directly from local farms whenever possible, and take great pride in offering an assortment of items from other local partners year-round. We are truly delighted to create great-tasting, super-nutritious juices, smoothies and foods – if your favorite thing is not on our menu just let us know! …we have fun at what we do and look forward to being of service to you in any capacity.</p>
		<p>You enter a juice bar with the purpose of being healthy, right? What if we told you most of the common ingredients (we’re looking at you Berries, Leafy Greens, Cucumbers, Celery, and Coffee) found at these juice bars are on the list as some of the most highly contaminated foods on the planet? We believe in organic. We believe it is the most efficient way to reduce exposure to chemicals and pesticides, avoid GMOs, and benefit from the higher nutrient content.</p>
